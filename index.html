          Revolving lines of credit are made by CBW Bank, Member FDIC, and Bright Capital Inc., NMLS (2410428), subject
          to state residency. Personal loans are made by our referral partners independent of Bright. Deposit accounts
          are provided by Evolve Bank & Trust or CBW Bank, Members FDIC. Bright is a financial technology company and
          non-depository lender, not a bank.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="text2">
          1. Revolving line of credit ranging from $500-$8,000 to help repay credit cards. Variable APR range from 9%
          –29.99%. Subject to Credit Approval. Final terms may vary depending on credit review, not all applicants will
          qualify for full loan amount. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Bright may also offer Personal
          Loans made by our referral partners. Bright Credit is line of credit and not a credit or debit card.
          <br>
          2. When you check your rates for Bright Credit we initiate a “soft pull” of your credit. This will NOT impact
          your credit score. If you’re approved and activate Bright Credit we may do a hard inquiry which may affect you
          credit score.
          <br>
          3. Bright uses standard industry practices to determine our customer satisfaction score. It's a metric used in
          all kinds of businesses to measure customer service and product quality. Businesses calculate their score by
          taking the number of satisfied customers (those who rated them 4 or higher) and dividing it by the total
          number of responses.
